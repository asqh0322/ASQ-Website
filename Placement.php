<p class="underline_head">Resume Tips: Five Ways to
Grab Employers' Attention</p>
<p class="general">With today's level of competition
for good jobs your resume has got only one chance to make a great first
impression. To be considered for interviews your resume must have that
special something that grabs the reader's attention and motivates them
to call you. Here are five strategies for transforming a blah document
into a WOW resume that will get employers calling you.</p>
<dl>
<di></di>
<p class="gen_footer">Keep your focus clear and to
the point</p>
<dd>The first thing potential employers need to know is
what you do and the position you are interested in. In the past job
seekers have used an objective statement at the top of their resume to
indicate their employment interest. With the lightning speed scanning
approach that recruiters take in viewing resumes, a wordy, vague
objective statement taking up three or more lines of text just doesn't
get the job done. In most cases they don't get read.<br>
Instead, write a short, direct professional summery that clearly
illustrates your career focus. Your statement should include your
profession, how long you've done it and your particular areas of
expertise. Something to the effect of:
<p class="emphasis">Senior purchasing
professions with 10 years' procurement expertise i<n: sourcing="" negotiation="" financial="" analysis="" strategic="" planning="" leadership="" contract="" law="" and="" process="" improvement=""></n:></p>
Remember, your resume is not an historical tell-all. To keep your focus
clear make sure that everything following in your resume relates to
your focus. Leave off extraneous details.</dd>
<di></di>
<p class="gen_footer">Stuff your resume with key
words.</p>
<dd>The more key words you use the more frequently your
resume will show up in online searches like LinkedIn, TheLadders and
CareerBuilder, etc.. Additionally, employer resume data bases also use
key words to query for qualifying candidates. Without appropriate key
words your resume will be electronically ignored. Without key words,
your resume is being shot off into a black void each time you submit it.<br>
A good way to make sure your resume is full of key words is to check it
against job postings. Use as many of the key words found in the
responsibilities and qualifications sections of job postings. As much
as you can, match up your terminology with what you find in job
postings.</dd>
<di></di>
<p class="gen_footer">Keep your resume
reader-friendly.</p>
<dd>Nothing gets ignored like a resume full of lengthy
blocks of text. No one has time to read through that much information.
Resume screeners need to be able to absorb your information quickly.
Leave out extraneous details so that key facts show up easily. Separate
blocks of text into smaller easy-to-digest snippets of information. Use
white space to separate bullet points so that each stand out. Be sure
that your font size is readable: nothing smaller than 11 point.</dd>
<di></di>
<p class="gen_footer">Include plenty of
accomplishments.</p>
<dd>If you want to stand out from the crowd you must
include accomplishments throughout your resume. Write accomplishments
that show how you solve universal problems such as saving time, cutting
costs, improving performance and increasing customer satisfaction. Your
accomplishments should stand out on your resume in bullets separate
from your responsibilities. Don't make the common mistake of combining
responsibilities and accomplishments in a long list of bullets. List
your responsibilities in a small block of text and your accomplishments
in bullet form following.</dd>
<di></di>
<p class="gen_footer">Get your best information on
page one.</p>
<dd>It's true, if you can't grab their attention on page
one they won't stick it out to find out the wonderful things you've got
on page two or three. This presents a problem for those who experienced
their most productive work five or more years back. The solution is to
use the hybrid resume format that allows you to create a highlight of
accomplishments section at the top of page one of your resume. This
area of your resume is reserved for the best examples of your work. The
accomplishments you include should illustrate the key transferable
skills needed for the position you are interested in.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="general">Don't delay in implementing these
resume changes. Employers are waiting for you with opportunities for a
better career and a better life.</p>

COUNSELING for those who may be on a job search</td>

<p class="emphasis">So Why Should We Hire You?&#8221;</p>
<p class="general">If you are currently in a job
search chances are
you've been asked that question already. Undoubtedly, it is the most
feared
interview question, but one of the most common. It pays to be ready to
answer
it. Helps to understand that the question is an invitation for you to
sell
yourself. This is a good thing. No one is going to hire you until they
have
been sold on you. This is your chance to state your value to the
prospective
employer. The best way to answer this question is to prepare for it
like a
sales person. There are three steps to selling yourself with confidence.</p>
<p class="gen_footer">Know your product &#8220;YOU.&#8221;</p>
<p class="general">Every successful salesperson
knows their product
inside and out. They understand the benefits of each product feature.
In like
manner, you must be able to articulate your transferable skills. First,
take
inventory of your skills. Make sure the skills you focus on are in
demand for
the position you seek. Next, take stock of the times of crisis when
you've used
those skills to solve problems. Finally, ask yourself what your
employer got
out of your successes on the job. Did you save time or money, increase
revenue,
improve service or increase productivity? Your success stories carry
more weight
when you can quantify the results. These success stories make up your
selling
points.</p>
<p class="gen_footer">Know the challenges of the
position.</p>
<p class="general">Before you can tell them why they
should hire you, you
must understand their current challenges. After all, you couldn't sell
a car
unless you knew understood how it was to be used. Until you know what
challenges go with the position you won't know which of your selling
points to
talk about. To learn about their challenges you must ask them.<br>
In the beginning of the interview ask your
interviewer, &#8220;What challenges do you see as most significant for this
position in the first six months?&#8221; Take careful note of his/her
response.
You will learn the &#8220;hot button&#8221; issues that you must sell you.</p>
<p class="gen_footer">Match your skills to their
challenges</p>
<p class="general">Here is where you get to sell
yourself. Once you
understand the critical skills they need for the job you simply share
with them
your success stories of when you have faced similar problems and how
you solved
them. Be sure to include the all-important benefit your company
received. Start
off your value statements with phrases like:</p>
<p class="emphasis">&#8220;I found a significant savings
opportunity when...&#8221;<br>
&#8220;My team gained efficiency when I discovered how to...&#8221;<br>
&#8220;My boss achieved his quarterly objective when I...&#8221;</p>
<p class="general">Remember, even if you don't get
asked &#8220;why
should we hire you&#8221; it is the underlying question and the point of the
whole interview. Job interviews are your chance to sell your skills,
talents
and expertise. Before your next interview practice good salesmanship
and
prepare to sell yourself like a pro.</p>
