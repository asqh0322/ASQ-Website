<h5>What:</br></br>Quality Profession, Skills and Technology: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow:</h5>


<p class=general>Quality, as a profession, is a constant from the European Guilds, 1000 years ago, to contemporary cyber-warfare. However, the control of the definition and measurement of Quality is evolving from the hands of the practitioner to the keystroke of the internet expert.  This session reviews the vital relationship between the Quality Profession, relevant skills and technology in the past and present. Using practical examples, the session suggests how those in the profession of quality can incrementally prepare for and control future standards in business and industry, healthcare, and education.</p>

<h5>Who:</br></br>Dr. Bob Gee, MBB</h5>

<p class = general>Dr. Bob Gee, Ph.D. achieved international, national and state recognitions for higher education achievements in quality management.  Dr. Gee was a pilot Baldrige Examiner in Education and Healthcare, guest speaker at Yale University, and recipient of the federal "Excellence in Government" award for design of educational programs at the United States Coast Guard.  Dr. Gee's keynote presentations include an ISO series in Lebanon, on medical education and quality practice in Davos, Switzerland, as Judge of International Team awards for Phillips Lighting, and on global quality standards at the China National Six Sigma Conference.
