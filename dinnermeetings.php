<h5>What:</br></br>Dealing with Difficult Team Members and Stakeholders:</h5>

<p class=general>Much of the workplace centers around negotiation—objectives, expectations, timeframe, and budget. There are occasions where negotiation may be impossible, such as when budget limitations simply won’t allow additional money to be approved, but sometimes plain human stubbornness keeps the team from making progress.

</br></br>Stakeholders and Team Members are critical to any organization’s success—teams rely on them for
information, feedback, and support. But occasionally you’ll come across a stakeholder or team member that
adds more hassle than help.

</br></br>Together we will explore a field guide to help you spot the four most common, difficult stakeholders and team
members and learn how to deal with the “Name Dropper”, the “Empire Builder”, the “Vanisher” and the
“Bosser”.
</p>
