<h5>What:</br></br>Planning for Failure: The Power of Defensive Pessimism:</h5>

<p class=general>Cheer up. Be Happy. Find the silver lining. Smile. If you didn't know any better, you might say we're a country
that preaches optimism. But some 30 to 35 percent of Americans employ a calculated form of negative thinking,
called defensive pessimism, that can lead to very positive results.

<br/><br/>We're not talking about a general disposition to see every glass as half-empty: "Defensive pessimism is a
strategy used in specific situations to manage anxiety, fear, and worry". Defensive pessimists prepare for a
situation by setting low expectations for themselves or a process, then follow up with a very detailed assessment
of everything that may go wrong.

<Br/><br/>Once they imagine the full range of things that can go wrong or bad outcomes, they start figuring out how to
handle them and this gives them a sense of control. Studies have shown that defensive pessimists tend to be
very successful people, and their low opinion of outcomes isn't realistic; they use it to motivate themselves to
perform better. If you pressure them into being optimistic, or try to manipulate their mood, their performance
deteriorates.

<br/><br/>Defensive pessimism is a tool to prepare for everything, even failure. If you encounter failure, you are prepared,
ready and hopefully it is not catastrophic. We will discuss tools to use in your personal and professional
environment.
