  <tr><td class=tdborder><a name=Gantt></a><p class=section_header>Gantt Chart</p>
  <p class=general>Also Called: milestones chart, project bar chart, activity chart.</p>
  <p class=underline_head>Description</p>
  <p class=general>A Gantt chart is a bar chart that shows the tasks of a
  project, when each must take place and how long each will take. As the
  project progresses, bars are shaded to show which tasks have been completed.
  People assigned to each task also can be represented.</p>
  <p class=underline_head>When to Use Gantt Charts</p>
   <ul id=disc>
   <li>When scheduling and monitoring tasks within a project.</li>
   <li>When communicating plans or status of a project.</li>
   <li>When the steps of the project or process, their sequence and their duration are known.</li>
   <li>When it&#8217;s not necessary to show which tasks depend on completion of previous tasks.</li>
   </ul>
  <p class=underline_head>Gantt Chart Basic Procedure</p>
  <p class=gen_header>Construction</p>
  <ol class=number>
   <li>Identify tasks:</li>
   <dl>
    <dd>Identify the tasks needed to complete the project.</li>
    <dd>Identify key milestones in the project by brainstorming a list, or by drawing a <a
        href="http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/process-analysis-tools/overview/flowchart.html">flowchart</a>,
        storyboard or <a
        href="http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/new-management-planning-tools/overview/arrow-diagram.html">arrow
        diagram</a> for the project.</li>
    <dd>Identify the time required for each task.</li>
    <dd>Identify the sequence: Which tasks must be finished before a following task can begin, and which can happen simultaneously? Which tasks must be
        completed before each milestone?</li>
   </dl>
   <li>Draw a horizontal time axis along the top or bottom of a page. Mark it off in an appropriate scale for the length of the tasks (days or weeks).</li>
   <li>Down the left side of the page, write each task and milestone of the project in order. For events that happen at a point in time (such as a
       presentation), draw a diamond under the time the event must happen. For activities that occur over a period of time (such as developing a plan
       or holding a series of interviews), draw a bar that spans the appropriate times on the timeline: Align the left end of the bar with
       the time the activity begins, and align the right end with the time the activity concludes. Draw just the outlines of the bars and diamonds;
       don&#8217;t fill them in.</li>
   <li>Check that every task of the project is on the chart.</li>
  </ol>
  <hr class=gray></hr>
  <p class=gen_header>Using the Chart</p>
  <ol start=5 type=1>
   <li>As events and activities take place, fill in the diamonds and bars to show completion. For tasks in progress, estimate how far along you are and fill in that much of the
       bar.</li>
   <li>Place a vertical marker to show where you are on the timeline. If the chart is posted on the wall, for example, an easy way to show the current time is with a heavy dark
       string hung vertically across the chart with two thumbtacks.</li>
  </ol>
  <hr class=gray></hr>
  <p class=gen_header>Gantt Chart Example</p>
  <p class=general>The figure below shows a Gantt chart used to plan a
  benchmarking study. Twelve weeks are indicated on the timeline. There are two
  milestone events, presentations of plans for the project and for the new process
  developed in the study. The rest of the tasks are activities that stretch
  over periods of time. </p>
  <p class=center><img class=imggraphic src="news_files/image002.jpg" alt="Gantt Chart Example", alt="Gantt Chart Image"></p>
  <p class=gen_header>Gantt Chart Example</p>
  <p class=general>The chart shows the status at Thursday of the sixth
  week. The team has finished seven tasks through identifying key practices,
  measures and documentation.</p>
  <p class=general>This is a hectic time on the project, with three
  time-consuming activities that must happen simultaneously:</p>
  <ul id=circle>
    <li>The team estimates it is
       one-fourth finished with identifying benchmark partners and scheduling
       visits; one-fourth of that bar is filled.</li>
    <li>Team members have not yet
       begun to identify the current state. </li>
    <li>They are halfway through
       collecting public data, which puts them slightly ahead of schedule for
       that task. </li></ul>
  <p class=general>They are behind schedule for the first two of these
  tasks and ahead of schedule for the third. Perhaps they need to reallocate
  their workforce to be able to cover the three activities simultaneously. </p>
  <p class=general>There is a fourth activity that could be happening now
  (develop benchmark questions), but it is not urgent yet. Eventually the team
  will have to allocate resources to cover it too, before visits can begin. </p>
  <hr class=gray></hr>
  <p class=gen_header>Gantt Chart Considerations</p>
  <ul id=circle>
   <li>Sometimes Gantt charts are drawn with additional columns showing details such as the amount of time the task is expected
      	to take, resources or skill level needed or person responsible.</li>
   <li>Beware of identifying reviews or approvals as events unless they really will take place at a specific time, such as a 
	meeting. Reviews and approvals often can take days or weeks.</li>
   <li>The process of constructing the Gantt chart forces group members to think clearly about what must be done to accomplish 
	their goal. Keeping the chart updated as the project proceeds helps manage the project and head off schedule problems.</li>
   <li>It can be useful to indicate the critical points on the chart with bold or colored outlines of the bars.</li>
   <li>Computer software can simplify constructing and updating a Gantt chart.</li>

  <p class=emphasis>By Ron Atkinson, ASQ past president</p>
  <p class=general>FMEA is a step-by-step approach for
  identifying all possible failures in a design, a manufacturing or assembly
  process, or a product or service. Keep in mind the following tips to make
  sure you and your organization succeed when applying FMEA.</p>
  <ul id=disc>
    <li>Give initial FMEA training on an object that is common to the students and not part of their work processes. That way
	they can concentrate on the concepts. Move on to actual work processes when the concepts are understood.</li>
    <li>The logical sequence is to do Design FMEA training followed by Process FMEA training. It is actually easier to grasp
	the concepts by doing the Process FMEA first and then transfer the concepts to the Design FMEA.</li>
    <li>Failure is the inability of the item or activity being studied to perform its intended function. This can happen even
	if the part or process does not 'break.'</li>
    <li>FMEA evaluates <i>potential</i> failures. An FMEA does not mean that the failure has occurred in the past or will 
	occur in the future; it means that it <i>could</i> occur.</li>
    <li>The cause of the failure is often given as the potential failure mode. This creates a problem and results in confusion
	when identifying the cause.&nbsp; Example: People see a tire without air and state that the failure mode is a nail in
	the tire. The tire losing air pressure slowly is the potential failure mode and a nail in the tire is the cause.</li>
    <li>Better definition of the requirements of the design or process make the rest of the FMEA easier.</li>

<tr><td class=tdborder><a name=Garden></a><p class=section_header>Quality professionals must cultivate success
  in their &#8216;organizational gardens&#8217;</p>
  <p class=emphasis>--Excerpt from Quality Progress, November 2008&#8212;</p>
  <p class=general>Quality professionals are constantly confronting practical questions that are always specific to the 
	organizations they serve: How do we grow our quality efforts? How can I keep my organization&#8217;s approach to 
	quality vibrant? How do I keep the leadership focused on quality? Should we be changing the focus of our quality 
	program? How do I transplant a successful quality endeavor from one part of the organization into another?</p>
  <p class=general>Many quality professionals understand that the answers to these questions require the ability to envision
	their organizations as living entities, existing within their understanding of systems theory. This requires quality 
	professionals to function along the lines of organizational gardeners who cultivate their organizations so they can 
	produce beauty on many levels.</p>
  <p class=underline_head>A basic approach</p>
  <p class=general>Regardless of whether an individual is an organizational gardener in a manufacturing, healthcare, service, government,
	education or not-for-profit setting, the task of tending to an organization can be difficult because it&#8217;s easy to lose sight of 
	four basic gardening principles:</p>
  <dl>
    <di><p class=gen_footer>Expect the seasons</p></di>
      <dd>Start with the premise that everything changes and that no action you or your organization takes will ever be 
	permanent. Your task is to study your organization as it exists right now, to think about how it can be improved, and 
	then to perform the necessary pruning, spraying, transplanting and other actions.</dd>   
    <di><p class=gen_footer>It is all an interconnected ecosystem</p></di>
      <dd>Each organization is a complex system of interconnected parts that exists within an even larger ecosystem of
	  social, economic and political conditions. The term &quot;unintended consequences&quot; is just another way of 
	  saying we didn&#8217;t think things through from a systems perspective before we implemented change.</dd>
    <di><p class=gen_footer>Don&#8217;t spray everything</p></di>
      <dd>Just because you own a set of garden tools does not mean you are a gardener. It is important to have a variety of 
	  tools and even more important to know when to use them and when not to use them. Don&#8217;t spray the herbicide on 
	  everything in sight just because you have it.<br><br> Most quality professionals have experienced a time when their 
	  organization went overboard with a particular tool and attempted to apply it in an uncritical manner. This causes 
	  cynicism about quality simply responding to the fad of the month.</dd>
    <di><p class=gen_footer>Get dirty</p></di>
      <dd>Organizational gardening requires a lot of hard work and the mastery of a complex body of knowledge (BoK). This 
	  mastery only comes through a process known as praxis, in which we use our understanding of theory to inform our 
	  practice and use our practical experiences to reflect on and refine our understanding of theory.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p class=underline_head>Alter your perception</p>
  <p class=general>We sometimes get in a rut when it comes to how we
  approach organizational issues and the perspective from which we understand
  organizational gardening. Research into how the mind functions suggests our
  perceptions about quality and our preferences for approaches might be
  influenced by our brain preference, leading us to ask whether we are
  left-brained or right-brained gardeners.</p>
  <p class=general>For the
  purposes of helping quality professionals think about getting dirty as
  organizational gardeners, it could be useful to look at quality methods
  simultaneously from two dimensions. One dimension would organize principles
  and methods according to whether they establish and promote order or whether
  they engender change, as Whitehead might suggest. The other dimension
  considers whether the principles and methods are linear and orderly (the
  left-brain preference) or relational in terms of complex systems (the
  right-brain preference). Figure 1 provides a matrix of the BoK from this
  perspective.</p>
  <p class=center><img class=imgsquare src="news_files/image003.gif" alt="Org Gardening BOK">>/p>
  <p class=general>The greatest challenge for the quality practitioner as
  organizational gardener might be facilitating the movement from one quadrant
  to another when the needs of the organization require a change in thinking
  and action. While the detailed, day-to-day digging in the organizational dirt
  in the conformance quadrant is essential, it is equally important at times to
  move over to the assessment quadrant and evaluate the relative beauty of the
  garden and decide what to uproot, trim or fertilize next.</p>
  <p class=general>When it comes to promoting change, quality professionals
  show a marked preference for working in the orderly change quadrant.
  Remember, the orderly introduction of change (improvement) needs to be
  balanced by the work in the conformance and assessment quadrants. So where
  does the right-brained, relational approach to promote change fit in?</p>
  <p class=underline_head>Ethical dilemma</p>
  <p class=general>When quality professionals are dealing with macro-level
  quality issues in their organizations while functioning as organizational
  gardeners, there are some ethical considerations to ponder.</p>
  <p class=general>When working within a system, there is no neutrality.
  Quality practitioners cannot park themselves in a safe, neutral part of the
  system. That&#8217;s because they are part of the system. From
  Whitehead&#8217;s perspective, every action we take is either going to
  promote greater order or promote change.</p>
  <p class=underline_head>Don&#8217;t be afraid to dig in</p>
  <p class=general>There is no shortage of quality practitioners who can
  conduct an audit, lead a group through a Six Sigma process improvement
  routine or plot control charts, even though these specific areas require
  expert skill and knowledge. Today&#8217;s challenge goes back to the issues
  that prompted Philip Crosby to establish the Quality College, that motivated
  Joseph Juran to establish the Juran Center, and that called Deming to teach
  countless workshops at George Washington University.</p>
  <p class=general>All three of these quality leaders were trying to help
  everyone see quality from a systems perspective and impart a breadth of
  understanding that could enable us to nurture and grow quality in organizations
  for the betterment of society. The garden is calling, and it won&#8217;t
  wait. You probably have some organizational gardening of your own to do. Dig
  in.</p>

  Lean Six Sigma visual tool that provides a powerful overview of a process. It
  helps in mapping the flow of people and material, delivering care or service
  in an organization. The pathways taken by people working in the process and
  the use of supplies when drawn on a paper often resembles cooked spaghetti,
  hence the name. The spaghetti map helps in quantifying the distances

  quality is cross functionality. This principle is embedded in many current
  quality management standards. For instance, ANSI/ISO/ASQ Q9001-2000 says the
  following:</p>
  <p class=emphasis>&#8220;The application of a
  system of processes within an organization, together with the identification
  and interactions of these processes, and their management, can be referred to
  as the &#8216;process approach.&#8217;</p>
  <p class=emphasis>&#8220;An advantage of the
  process approach is the ongoing control that it provides over the linkage
  between the individual processes within the system of processes, as well as
  over their combination and interaction.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=general>How do you audit interaction? In
  Figure 1&#8217;s example, the columns are the general departments at most
  companies (or they could be specific processes). The roof becomes all the
  interactions between any two departments.</p>
  <p class=center><img class=imgsquare src="news_files/image005.jpg" alt="QFD House"></p>
  <p class=general>There are eight departments in
  this example, making the number of two-way interactions 28 (8C2). With eight departments,
  the roof would be made up of 28 interactions. Is it necessary to audit all 28
  interactions? Probably not. You can always do a Pareto chart and audit the
  six vital few interactions. Which six? Probably by consensus we can agree on
  four or five interactions of the six vital few.</p>
  <p class=general>Not only do we have four bad
  (&#8211;) interactions, we also have four good (+) ones. You can audit for
  objective evidence of the bad interactions to begin a process of determining
  root cause and implementing effective corrective action. We can audit the
  positive interactions to collect &#8220;what we do well&#8221; information
  (the appreciative inquiry method).</p>
  <p class=general>For example, you can audit the
  bad interaction between the engineering and production departments to
  objectively shed light on the problem. You can audit how the engineering
  department produces and delivers standards to the production department. You
  can audit the production department on how useful it finds the engineering
  department&#8217;s standards. A revealing exercise is to see if the supplier
  output is equal to the customer input, as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
  <p class=center><a href="http://www.asq.org/img/qp/075605_figure2.gif" target="_blank">
   <img class=imgsquare src="news_files/image007.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a>
  <p class=general>As a positive example, you can
  audit the interaction between the HR and production departments to identify
  something you want to continue and perhaps replicate. You can audit HR on how
  it hires production workers. Perhaps you would find that HR goes to observe
  the actual work environment. You can audit how the production
  department&#8217;s new hires perform. Per-haps you would discover that HR
  receives feedback one month later on how a new hire is working out.</p>
  <p class=general>Auditing interactions would
  require you to expand the scope of audits to include more than one department
  or process. Auditing several departments or processes might sound impossible
  with time and budget constraints. But remember, scope down audits of
  suppliers to a specific commodity in the main process you are auditing. If
  nothing else, make sure all your audits cover at least two departments or two
  processes. You must begin auditing the way the business actually
  operates&#8212;a system of processes, including interactions.</p>
  <p class=general>Another use of the roof is to
  determine how to build cross functional teams, perhaps to tackle a Six Sigma
  project. If you know there is a weak relationship between two functions, why
  not put representatives from these areas on the same team with a single
  purpose? I have seen a weak relationship become strong through a team
  building process. Moreover, this strong team relationship might have a
  spillover effect on day-to-day business operations.</p>
  <p class=general>Whether forming cross functional
  teams or auditing process interactions, you will provide value added
  information for management review of the effectiveness of the quality system.
  Using the house of quality for cross functionality and interactions makes
  sense.</p>
  <p class=general>After all, aren&#8217;t your
  departments and processes under one roof?</p>

  <p class=general>One of the
  more useful and popular methods used by quality professionals is root cause analysis
  (RCA). But, there are instances in which RCA isn&#8217;t the best choice.</p>
  <p class=general>One such
  situation is when working to reduce the chance and cost of recalls and
  especially product liability lawsuits, according to Randall Goodden, chair of
  ASQ&#8217;s Product Safety and Liability Prevention Interest Group for the
  past 12 years (the group was established in 1981).</p>
  <p class=general>Goodden says
  RCA and failure mode and effects analysis, which is in the same category,
  help design engineers not only determine why a product might not last as long
  as intended, but also predict what could fail.</p>
  <p class=general>&#8220;In
  those cases, you&#8217;re looking more at product reliability. But,
  preventing hazards that will ultimately lead to recalls and possible lawsuits
  requires a different type of analysis,&#8221; Goodden explains. &#8220;This
  analysis is much more in-depth than RCA and includes all the ways the product
  is likely to be used, as well as misused,&quot; and how anyone who comes into
  contact with the product could be injured.</p>
  <p class=general>Another point
  Goodden makes about RCA and FMEA is that they&#8217;re commonly conducted by
  design engineers on <em>their own</em> designs. But, the unfortunate fact,
  according to Goodden, is that the majority of products that are being
  recalled involve issues related to design defects. </p>
  <p class=general>&#8220;Prevention
  of design defects requires an independent analysis of what would lead to
  faulty designs,&#8221; says Goodden. &#8220;Product safety teams should be
  made up of a small group of specially trained people, such as safety and
  quality engineers, who have a very in-depth view as to how a product will be
  used and who will use it. They must analyze the proposed design on behalf of
  the entire company and become specialists in this area.&#8221; </p>
  <p class=general>Goodden
  believes product safety teams should be comprised of these independent
  positions, as opposed to manufacturing or engineering personnel, that are
  likely to face timeframe pressures.</p>
  <p class=general>What tools are
  available to product safety teams? In addition to software packages that
  perform hazard analyses and risk assessments, Goodden says these teams can use
  data from previous products, including customer feedback, warranty returns,
  and customer returns from the field.</p>
  <p class=general>Brainstorming
  sessions and checklists that feature previous problems with a product are
  also quite helpful. Most importantly, however, Goodden says product safety
  team members need to have special training in how to recognize potential
  hazards.</p>
  <p class=general>&#8220;RCA and
  FMEA help determine whether a product will be reliable and do what it is
  intended to do, and lead to satisfied customers,&#8221; concludes Goodden.
  &#8220;Hazard analysis and risk assessment by a product safety team will go
  beyond just ensuring the product will be reliable and live up to the
  customer's expectations, by reducing the chance and cost of recalls that
  could then lead to product liability lawsuits.&#8221;</p>
